Things Done:

(1) I integrated The mysql database 
(2) During Registration the user's data is stored in the a table(mytable) in mysql 
(3) Later during the login I check the given details with that of present in the table and allow the user to proceed
(4) Initally i generated the bare login page.later i used the jsp files for UI.
(5) I also generated Allusers functionality where the data of all users is displayed(idea is to bring data from mysqldb to the webbrowser)
(6) I created the newtransaction functionality which takes the transaction details and stores the data in a new table(transactions).
